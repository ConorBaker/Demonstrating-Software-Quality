## Scrum Sprint Backlog and Task Estimation 
 
### Sprint 1

### Sprint 2
|  Task	| Estimation 	|  Priority |
|-	|-	|-	|
| Create Skeleton Controller Class	|  1	|  1	|
| Write Tests for adding new Rubric and assigning Criterion	| 1 	| 2 	|

| Write Tests for creating a new Student and assigning Grades	|  1	| 3 	|
| Implement Student and Grades Methods 	|  2	|  6	|

Each item was taken from the backlog and assessed briefly, a temporarily estimate was then assigned to the item. This estimate was then compared to others and final estimates were assigned. For example to compare the "Create Skeleton Controller Class" task and the "Implement Summary Calculations Methods" task in Sprint 2, these two have very different estimations. Creating the skeleton class will be quite straight forward to do so it has a low estimation, while the Summary Calculations will be more complex with math algorithms.

The velocity is looked at at the end of each sprint to see the work competed in that sprint and to estimate the work that can be done in the next one.
